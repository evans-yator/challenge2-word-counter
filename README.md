13.
Create a program that generates a random password. The password should be at least 8 characters long and contain a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
1.
Create a program that reads in a text fi le and counts the number of occurrences of each word in the fi le. The program should then print out a list of the top 10 most frequent words, along with their counts.
2.
Create a program that simulates a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The program should prompt the user to enter their choice, then randomly generate the computer's choice. The program should then determine the winner based on the standard rules of the game.
3.
Create a program that reads in a CSV fi le containing data on a set of stocks. The program should then calculate the average daily return for each stock and print out a list of the top 10 performing stocks.
4.
Create a program that generates a random maze and solves it using the depth-fi rst search algorithm. The program should display the maze, show the path from the start to the fi nish, and calculate the time taken to solve the maze.
5.
Create a program that generates a set of random coordinates on a 2D plane and calculates the shortest path that visits each point exactly once. The program should use a genetic algorithm to fi nd an optimal solution.
6.
Create a program that reads in a text fi le and creates a word cloud, where the size of each word is proportional to its frequency in the text. The program should then display the word cloud as an image.
7.
Create a program that scrapes a website for data on a particular topic and creates a visualization of the data. For example, the program could scrape a news website for data on the most common topics in the news, then create a pie chart showing the distribution of topics.
8.
Create a program that generates a set of random numbers and sorts them using the quicksort algorithm. The program should then calculate the time taken to sort the numbers.
9.
Create a program that reads in a text fi le and creates a markov chain model of the text. The program should then use the model to generate a random sentence that is similar in style to the original text.
